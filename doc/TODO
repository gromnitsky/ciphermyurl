- [ ] JS (de)ciphering of a data in a browser: user knows a password, so
      he ciphers the data and sent it to us encrypted + a hash of a
      password. We cannot decrypt the data because of the password
      hash. But in unpack mode, user knows the password, so he decrypts
      the data in the browser.

- [ ] Visual indicator of the number of characters in the textarea.
