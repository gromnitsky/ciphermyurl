* TODO Next versions

- [ ] JS (de)ciphering of data in a browser: user knows a password, so
      he ciphers the data and sent it to us encrypted. We cannot decrypt
      the data because we store hashed passwords. But in unpack mode,
      user knows the password, so he decrypts the data in the
      browser. All this staff must be under TLS.

- [ ] Visual indicator of a textarea buffer size.

- [ ] Mobile views.

- [ ] Use key-value store that supports transactions.

- [ ] Rewrite to sinatra's 'modular app' style.
