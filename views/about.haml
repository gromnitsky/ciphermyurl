        The original idea came from this clever guy:
        = succeed '.' do
          %a(href="https://plus.google.com/102094915438818669469/posts/g4tYBNoSTod") https://plus.google.com/102094915438818669469/posts/g4tYBNoSTod

        For non-russian speakers: in public networks you may bump into
        URL censoring. You send a link to your friend but suddenly a
        transfer agent (TA) thinks that the link is 'bad' and he
        silently cuts it from your message. What th...

      %p
        You may try to use a url shortener, but nothing can prevent TA
        to resolve such link by himself and filter it again.

      %p
        So here it comes #{project}--a 'cipher' that hides any text (not
        just a URL) behind a number & a password. Bob doesn't sent to
        Alice a URL, Bob sent a number that corresponds to the
        URL. (It's very unlikely that any TA will filter numbers like
        456334 from messages.) Alice goes to #{project} and enters
        the number + password pair. It's possible, of course, to give
        her a URL with the already filled number and the password or
        just with the number.

      %p
        (The password exchange mechanism between Bob & Alice is out of
        scope of #{project}. For true secure communication nothing beats
        public-key cryptography (read: PGP, GnuPG).)

      %dl
        %dt Slot
        %dd
          A number that represent a data behind it. You cannot choose it
          by yourself--#{project} will automatically generate it for
          you.

        %dt To pack
        %dd
          To add some data to the #{project}. After packing you'll get a
          slot.

        %dt To unpack
        %dd
          To decipher a slot. You'll need a password for that. (It is not
          possible to make a slot without the password.)

        Despite its name, #{project} doesn't cipher anything--you
        password is hashed but the data goes as is--it's up to a client
        to encrypt it. Web-based part of #{project} is a client, but due
        to the fact that

        = succeed ',' do

        we need to do that under TLS.
